In today's challenge we will be touching the topics:

-

[Strong Pseudoprime](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StrongPseudoprime.html)

-

[Fermat Pseudoprime](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FermatPseudoprime.html)

-

[Carmichael Number](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CarmichaelNumber.html) (for bonus)

Fermat’s primality test consists of choosing many numbers and checking if they are witnesses to the compositeness of the number being tested.

There are some composite numbers which pass Fermat’s primality test for all possible witnesses; they are called Carmichael numbers

Because there exist numbers that fool Fermat’s primality test for all bases, a strong pseudo-primality test is often used

Your tasks are

-

to write two functions that test if a number is a Fermat pseudo-prime or a strong pseudo-prime to a given base

-

two functions that test primality using the Fermat and strong pseudo-prime tests.

Bonus:

Write two functions that test if a number is a Carmichael number, and to identify all the Carmichael numbers less than a given input number by the user.
