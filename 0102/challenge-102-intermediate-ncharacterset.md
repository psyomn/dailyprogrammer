Write a function that takes a string _s_ and an integer _n_, and returns whether or not the string _s_ contains **at most** _n_ different characters.

For example, `ncset("aacaabbabccc", 4)` would return `true` , because it contains only 3 different characters, 'a', 'b', and 'c', and 3 â‰¤ 4.

For how many English words (yes, it's time for [this dictionary](http://code.google.com/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads/detail?name=enable1.txt) again!) does `ncset(word, 4)` hold?
