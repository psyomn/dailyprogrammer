Given a string containing the English word for one of the single-digit numbers, return the number _without using any of the words in your code_. Examples:

eng\_to\_dec('zero') # => 0  
eng\_to\_dec('four') # => 4

Note: there is no right or wrong way to complete this challenge. Be creative with your solutions!
