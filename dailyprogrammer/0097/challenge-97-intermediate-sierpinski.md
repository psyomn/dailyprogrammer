Write a function that accepts an integer _n_ and returns a (3_n_ Ã— 3n ) boolean matrix containing a _n_th-iteration [Sierpinski carpet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_carpet) fractal.

- How many 1 bits are there in `carpet(7)` ?
- What is the largest value of `n` for which the matrix returned by `carpet(n)` fits in a terabyte?

For bonus points, write a general function `center_iter(d, n)` that generates fractals like the Sierpinski carpet in _d_ dimensions. ( `center_iter(1, n)` is the [Cantor set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set), center\_iter(2, n) the Sierpinski carpet, `center_iter(3, 1)` a 3x3x3 cube with the center piece removed, etc.)
